![birds](https://media3.giphy.com/media/3o7Zen0xHZFjAFiQ1O/giphy.gif)

## Instructions:

- Create a basic express server in the `bird-app` directory
    - You should have files `server.js`, `package.json`, and probably `package-lock.json`
- The endpoint `/birds` sends back the list of all birds in JSON format
   - You can import this from `/db/birds.js`
- The endpoint `/birds/1` sends back the bird in JSON format with `id: 1` & so on for each bird ID
- The endpoint `/birds/location/nyc` sends back all the birds from NYC in JSON format, & so on for the other locations

## Remember:

- Use the in-class project we worked on Monday as your reference for building out this birds project! But DO NOT copy and paste code! If you copy and paste you won't learn effectively. And we're all here to learn ✏️🎒
- We've created this [cheat sheet](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-arcadia/arcadia-class-info/wiki/Express-Cheat-Sheet) to help guide you in this process

## 🚀 Completion looks like:

- You have an express app in your `bird-app` directory
- Your express app includes a `server.js`, with accurate routes
- Your commit history has more than one commit

## 🚀 Your homework submission should include:

- A pull request created on _this repo_ (after you fork).
- A good commit history

### This homework is due 🚨 11PM TONIGHT 🚨
