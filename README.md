# HOMEWORK: Birds Routes!!

![bird](./assets/reps.jpg)

It's time to start writing some express!!!

## Let's Get Started!

- Create a basic express server in the `bird-app` directory
    - You should have files `server.js`, `package.json`, and probably `package-lock.json`
- The endpoint `/birds` sends back the list of all birds
   - You can import this from `/db/birds.js`
- The endpoint `/birds/1` sends back the bird with `id: 1`, & so on for each bird ID
- The endpoint `/birds/location/nyc` sends back all the birds from NYC, & so on for the other locations

### Bonus:
- Create a views folder, then create a home folder. The home `index.ejs` should display through endpoint `/` with whatever your homepage will be
- Create an additional `index.ejs` that displays the results for the endpoint `/birds`
- Create an additional view for `/birds/:id`
[Fell free to reference the ejs docs](http://ejs.co/)

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

- You have an express app in your `bird-app` directory
- Your express app includes a `server.js`, with accurate routes
- Your commit history has more than one commit


## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- A pull request created on _this repo_ (after you fork).
- A good commit history
- Homework template with completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due ðŸš¨ 11PM ON TUESDAY NIGHT ðŸš¨
